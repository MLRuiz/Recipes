Ingredients:

   * 2 tablespoons salted Butter
   * 12 large white button mushrooms, sliced
   * 1 cup diced onion
   * 1 pinch salt
   * 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
   * 2 tablespoons ketchup
   * 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
   * 3 cups high-quality, low-sodium beef broth
   * salt to taste
   * 2 tablespoons salted butter

Directions:

   1. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick pan over high heat; add mushrooms, onions, and a pinch of salt. Saute, stirring occasionally, until very nicely browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add flour. Cook and stir for 3 minutes.
   2. Stir in ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and beef broth; increase heat to high. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the gravy thickens slightly and reduces, about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust salt as needed. Transfer to a glass measuring cup, scraping the pan clean with a spatula, and reserve.
