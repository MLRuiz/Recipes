Original version:

   Base ingredients for a garam masala recipe:
- 1 cup coriander seeds, which release a sweet floral aroma when toasted
- 4 teaspoons cumin seeds add sweetness and bitterness

- The earthy, smoky flavors:
- 2 teaspoons black peppercorns for a sharp, earthy flavor
- 1 cinnamon stick for a sweet, woody flavor
- 2 bay leaves for a pungent, sharp and bitter taste
- 2 to 3 black cardamom pods give a smoky, minty flavor
   
- Aromatic spices:
- 8 to 10 green cardamom pods produce a zesty citrus flavor that can be both sweet and spicy
- 8 cloves add strong, pungent and astringent flavors
- 1 star anise gives the spice mix a sweet licorice flavor
- 2 mace blades add a sweet, woody, pungent aroma

Preparation:

1. Heat a skillet on medium heat and dry roast the spices for about 5 minutes, until aromatic. The spices should be roasted about 70 percent, not entirely.
2. Allow the spices to cool completely.
   3: Grind the spices using a coffee grinder or spice grinder -— an essential Indian cooking tool -— until they have a smooth mixture.
