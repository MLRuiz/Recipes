Ingredients:

Chicken and Sauce
1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into ½-inch cubes
¼ cup soy sauce, divided
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
½ teaspoon white pepper
1 tablespoon Chinese black vinegar
1 tablespoon packed dark brown sugar
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
Stir-Fry
1 tablespoon minced garlic
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, divided
½ cup dry-roasted peanuts
10 - 15 dried arbol chiles, halved lengthwise and seeded
1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns, ground coarse
2 celery ribs, cut into ½-inch pieces
5 scallions, white and light green parts only, cut into ½-inch pieces

Preparación:

1. For the Chicken and Sauce: Combine chicken, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, cornstarch, rice wine, and white pepper in medium bowl and set aside. Stir vinegar, sugar, oil, and remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce together in small bowl and set aside.
2. For the Stir-Fry: Stir garlic, ginger, and 1 tablespoon oil together in second small bowl. Combine peanuts and 1 teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until peanuts just begin to darken, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer peanuts to plate and spread into even layer to cool. Return now-empty skillet to medium-low heat. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil, arbols, and peppercorns and cook, stirring constantly, until arbols begin to darken, 1 to 2 minutes. Add garlic mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until all clumps are broken up and mixture is fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3. Add chicken and spread into even layer. Cover skillet, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, without stirring, for 1 minute. Stir chicken and spread into even layer. Cover and cook, without stirring, for 1 minute. Add celery and cook uncovered, stirring frequently, until chickenis cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add soy sauce mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened and shiny and coats chicken, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in scallions and peanuts. Transfer to platter and serve.
